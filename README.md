# React TypeScript Portfolio Project with Django Backend

This project is a personal portfolio and blog application built with **React** and **TypeScript** on the frontend and **Python** with **Django** and **Django REST Framework** on the backend. The portfolio showcases my projects, skills, and blog posts, with a focus on dynamic content and API-based interactions.

## Features

- **Portfolio Section**: Showcases my projects, skills, and experiences.
- **Blog Section**: Users can read and add blog posts, leave comments, and interact with posts.
- **Dynamic Content**: Data is fetched from the Django REST API to display posts and comments in real-time.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
- **Backend**: Built with Django and Django REST Framework to provide APIs for the frontend.
- **Authentication**: User authentication system (optional) to manage post creation and comment interaction.

## Technologies Used
