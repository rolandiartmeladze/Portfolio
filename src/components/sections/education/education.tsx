          I have independently completed several courses on YouTube and Udemy to
          strengthen my skills in backend development. These courses provided me
          with a solid foundation in Python, Django, and Nest.js, which I
          applied in the creation of multiple projects. By learning these
          technologies, I gained hands-on experience in building scalable
          applications and APIs, and I continue to implement this knowledge in
          real-world projects.
